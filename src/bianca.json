Concurrently, I am in charge of leading efforts to modernise legacy services within my team and the department to bolster system reliability and to create a culture that encourages teams to continuously improve. Besides that, I ensure that my team as well as the broader department is pioneering improvements in industry standards by adhering to best practices in software engineering and utilising advanced technologies like GraphQL and AWS. Additionally, I am in charge of overseeing the implementation of the new 'Request to Book' feature across several teams, aligning our offerings with industry benchmarks and to meet the needs of the customers. Moreover, my team is among the first teams to successfully implement a generative AI use case in production. Alongside my technical responsibilities, I am in charge of mentoring two other Engineering Managers, focusing on enhancing skills in feedback delivery and managing challenging conversations. As a stretch goal, I am participating in a company-wide technical initiative called Shift Left to help achieve company-level objectives. This initiative reports up to the VP level.
